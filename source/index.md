# Introduction

Welcome to the Skott Gateway API Documentation! You can use our API to access Skott Gateway API endpoints, which can act on your campaigns on your advertising systems (like the Demand-Side Platform MediaMath).

We have language bindings in Java. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](http://github.com/tripit/slate).

# Authentication

> To establish the connection to MediaMath's server, use this code:

```java
ConnectService myMMConnection = new ConnectService();
myMMConnection.verbose=true;
myMMConnection.login();
```

> You can give the name you want to this ConnectService object instead of 'myMMConnection'.

The Skott Gateway API allows you to manipulate objects such as SkottAdvertiser, SkottCampaign, SkottStrategy, etc (you find the full list of available entities in the [Entities](#entities) section). These objects are mapped with the MediaMath T1 entities advertiser, campaign, strategy, etc.

To be able to push your Skott objects to MediaMath and create new entities in your T1 account or update existing entities in your T1 account, you'll need first to establish the connection to MediaMath's servers. To do so, you need to instantiate a **ConnectService** object. Please get a look at the sample code on the right panel for more details.

<aside class="success">
Once the connection is established, you can use this ConnectService instance for several requests. Check each entity section to see when you need to use the ConnectService instance.

# Entities

## SkottAdvertiser

> This sample code shows how to create a new advertiser in MediaMath T1 using SkottAdvertiser's newBuilder method:

```java
SkottAdvertiser skottAdvertiser = 
	SkottAdvertiser.newBuilder()
		.setName("Advertiser 23122015")
		.setAgencyId(112292)
		.setAdServerId(2)
		.setDomain("http://www.skylads.com")
		.setVerticalId(1)
		.build();
		
skottAdvertiser.create(myMMConnection);
```

> This second sample code shows how to update an existing advertiser in MediaMath T1 using SkottAdvertiser's buildUpon method:

```java
SkottAdvertiser updatedAdvertiser = 
	SkottAdvertiser.buildUpon(new SkottAdvertiser(156242))
		.setAdServerId(9)
		.setDomain("http://www.skott.io")
		.setVerticalId(3)
		.build();
		
updatedAdvertiser.update(myMMConnection);
```

> Please note that in both cases you need to use an instance of a ConnectService object as an argument for the create method, if you want the changes to be done on your MediaMath T1 entity.

SkottAdvertiser is a java object of our SkottGateway API that maps the *advertiser* entity of MediaMath T1.

### Creating or updating an advertiser on MediaMath's T1 using SkottAdvertiser

You can either create a new object entirely on MediaMath T1 using SkottAdvertiser's **newBuilder** method (see code examples on the right panel for more details), or update an existing advertiser from MediaMath T1 using SkottAdvertiser's **buildUpon** method (see code examples on the right panel for more details).

In both cases you can then use a number of methods to affect desired values to the fields of this new or updated object. The table below lists all available methods to use with the builders. We use java's builder pattern to make these changes. You can find a lot more information about the builder pattern on the internet, here is just one example: [wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern). You can also check the code examples on the right panel for more details on how to use those methods with the newBuilder and buildUpon methods.

Please note that to actually create or update your object on MediaMath T1, you need an active connection to their server (the *myMMconnection* object in the code examples on the right panel). For more details on how to establish the connection, please read through our [Authentication](#authentication) section.
